# Python Codes

<p>I write these Python codes to solve the problems I encounter and to get to know more about Python and coding.</p>

* <p><a href="https://github.com/sohrabganjian/Python-Codes/blob/master/All_words_to_PDF.py">All_words_to_PDF.py</a> - This will make a PDF version of all the Word documents in the same directoty.</p>

* <p><a href="https://github.com/sohrabganjian/Python-Codes/blob/master/Grade_Calculator.py">Grade_Calculator.py</a> - This asks a user for a grade the user recived out of 100 and would ask the weight of the grade and would show how much it is worthed out of 100%.</p>

* <p><a href="https://github.com/sohrabganjian/Python-Codes/blob/master/PDF_merger.ipynb">PDF_merger.ipynb</a> - This will merge PDFs together.</p>

* <p><a href="https://github.com/sohrabganjian/Python-Codes/blob/master/PDF_split.ipynb">PDF_split.ipynb</a> - This splits a particular page of a pdf document.</p>

* <p><a href="https://github.com/sohrabganjian/Python-Codes/blob/master/Comparing%20Folders.ipynb">Comparing Folders.ipynb</a> - This compares the content of two folders.</p>

* <p><a href="https://github.com/sohrabganjian/Python-Codes/blob/master/merge_split.ipynb">merge_split.ipynb</a> - This lets you remove specific pages and merge other PDFs at specified pages. See this link for more details.</p>

* <p><a href="https://github.com/sohrabganjian/Python-Codes/blob/master/Device%20Performance.ipynb">Device Performance.ipynb</a> - This code let's you measure a quick benchmark for your device. Expect the running to be between 24 to 50 seconds. </p>

* <p><a href="https://github.com/sohrabganjian/Python-Codes/blob/master/MoveFiles_Undo.ipynb">MoveFiles_Undo.ipynb</a> - This code let's you move files that satisfy certain conditions from a parent directory and move them to a destination folder. Eventually, these files can be moved back to their original directory. Please see the notebook for more information. </p>

* <p><a href="https://github.com/sohrabganjian/Python-Codes/blob/master/Image_PDF.ipynb">Image_PDF.ipynb</a> - This code let's you convert your image to a PDF. There is also a workaround for transparent images that may raise an error. Please see the notebook for more details. </p>

* <p><a href="https://github.com/sohrabganjian/Python-Codes/blob/master/Merge_two_PDFs_at_a_Specified_Page.ipynb">Merge_two_PDFs_at_a_Specified_Page.ipynb</a> - This codes allows you to merge two PDFs at a specified page. The same code could be adjusted for more than two PDFs. </p>
